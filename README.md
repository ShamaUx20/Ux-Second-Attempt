### Where am I located?
I live in **Columbia**, Maryland. I moved here recently from **Cincinnati**, Ohio. This is nice, expensive city.

### Why am I taking this Unix course?
I am an IT professional for 20+ years; my work has been mostly on IBM Mainframe & MS Windows platform. Unix always intrigued me. With the ease of installing Ubantu on Windows machine, now I am trying to dive deeper.

### More on my current work
Currently, I am a contract Product Owner in a Scaled Agile Team. This team owns an Enterprise Application covering this Technology stack:
- Liferay Platform hosting the Primary Application
- Primary Application embraces Java, HTML, Web Methods, DB2 Procs/SQL/Triggers
- Vision is to move away from Liferay platform to Lighting iFraming Microservices.
- So the Vision tech stack includes Salesforce Lightning, Angular ionic, Node JS, Kafka Connectors, Cassandra database, Cassandra to DB2 Sync.

### Work in 2020
Covid has impacted our work both in *good* & *bad* ways:
*Good Way*:
1. Incorporated **remote working** as a new way allowing closer proximity to family
2. New tools are tested and adapted
3. Has cut-down **travel ime** and contributed to a healthier earth
4. **and more**

*Bad Way*:
1. Work hours are now extended encroaching even lunch and evening hours
2. Miss my coleagues, my Office, the break room
3. with teams distributed globally, expectation is that I am always availbalbe - insanity.
